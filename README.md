# AQ
Compare the performance using AQ dataset for Go, Python, and R languages

In this folder, each source code are created for iteration of 500 times to run the regression model and run with same treatment under CLI.
##Performance Result:
Python-- Average execution time over 500 iterations: 0.004805 seconds
R-- Average Process Time: 0.009390144 seconds
Go--  Average processing time for 500 iterations: 26.351Âµs

##Recommendation:
From the performance result, Go has the most outstanding process time which suggest its capability to process large amount of data in perspective of process speed. The concern for this performance test is also discussable. As Python code run with pre-installed library that greatly slow down the performance speed which may address its potential in process large dataset.
